This file contains installation instructions for DDcal.

PREREQUISITES
=============

To build DDcal you need to have installed on your system:

graphviz 1.7	(or higher specifically, you need dot in your PATH to run DDcal)
perl 5.6.0	(or higher)
Tk800.023	(or higher; this is perl/Tk)
flex 2.5.4	(or higher or lex)
bison 1.28	(or higher or yacc)
cudd-2.3.1	(or higher)

graphviz 1.7 is available from
	http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz
perl and perl/Tk are available from any CPAN site. See
	http://www.perl.com/perl/
or
	ftp://ftp.perl.com/perl/
for the list of the CPAN sites. You can also find the older version of
perl and Tk there, but there should be no reason not to install the
most recent ones.
flex and bison are available from
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/
or one of its mirrors.
cudd-2.3.1 or a more recent release is available from
	ftp://vlsi.colorado.edu/pub/

BUILDING DDcal
==============

Look at the Makefile. The only things that may need to be changed are the
definitions of WHERE, PREFIX, EXE, and PL.

Type `make'. This should build ddcal (which is called by DDcal). To test
the program, execute DDcal.pl. The `examples' directory contains some
files that you may want to load with the `Load' button.

Once you are satisfied, you can install DDcal by typing `make install.'
The default installation directory is /usr/local/bin. It can be changed
by changing the definition of PREFIX in the Makefile. Notice that
DDcal.pl is installed as DDcal under Unix and DDcal.pl under
Windows/Cygwin. You need write access to the taget installation directory.

That should be it.

PLATFORMS
=========

DDcal has been tested only under GNU/Linux RedHat 7.1 with
the program versions listed above.  It has also been built under some
versions of SunOS without any problems. Your mileage may vary.
DDcal also works under Windows/Cygwin with recent versions of cygwin.
The tricky part is to get perl-Tk to work.
