README file for the exp directory of the PdTRAV-1.2 package
Revision: version 1.2 June 01, 1999



This directory contains:
* a few blif files on which to run PdTRAV-1.2 (file extension: blif).
* a few script files showing how to run it (file extension: cmd).
* a few examples of outputs obtained running the program with the script
  files in a correct way (file extension: out).
* a link to the cmdHelp.txt file (in the cmd directory) to have the on-line
  help for PdTRAV.

After build PdTRAV execute it from this directory as:
../bin/pdtrav

Run the source files <name> with the command:
source <name>.cmd
or with the command
@<name>.cmd

A few source files may require one or more parameters (see comments inside
the source files themselves).
In this case run them as:
@<name>.cmd <parameter1> <parameter2> ...

Inside each command file you can find comments describing the operation done.
Comments are indicated with the starting character '#'.

Notice that to have the help command working correctly the cmdHelp.txt
file (or a symbolic link to it), must be in the working directory.
The cmdHelp.txt file can be found in the cmd directory.
Copy it in the working directory or make a link to it with the following
command:
ln -s <path to cmd directory>cmdHelp.txt .
