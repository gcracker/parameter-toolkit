README file for the PdTRAV-2.0Beta package
This is a Beta release, whith major changes from pdtrav-1.*.
Ddi is stable, we still require some work on the tr, fsm and trav packages
to complete release 2.0.



WHAT IS PDTRAV
==============

PdTRAV is a BDD based traversal tool created at Politecnico di Torino.
It is intended as a library, and includes a simple user interface for 
stand-alone usage.
It is written in C for the symbolic manipulation FSMs.
Currently, CUDD is used as low level BDD library.



INSTALLATION
============

To compile and link pdtrav, Cudd (version 2.3.0) is needed
on a sibling directory.
Proper makefile can be created by running configure in the main directory.

E.g. run

./configure

Once the Makefile has been created, run

make

In case you have problems you need to manually edit Makefile.

On the other hand, the user has to rely on the manual method.
The file "Makefile.custom" is a customable makefile, which should be edited to
set hardware-related options and flags.
Using that makefile would come in handy, should the user desire to enable
special compilation flags, e.g. optimization ones, or some unexpected
problem arise.
Several possible settings are already listed as comment lines. 
If you prefer this option, modify the "Makefile.custom" file so that the
settings meet your requirements.
Then run:
make -f Makefile.custom
This would run the "setup" file to create the "include" directory, the
"bin" directory, make symbolic links to include files, and compile the
Cudd package and the PdTRAV one.
An executable file, named "pdtrav", should be created in the "bin" directory.
   
From the root directory, the following command is also possible:
make -f Makefile.custom <command>
where <command> is:
  clean
    it cleans pdtrav only (not cudd)
  distclean
    it cleans distribution (cudd included) 

This kit has been successfully built on the following configurations:
  DEC Alpha running Digital Unix with gcc (and gnu make)
  PC running Linux with gcc

It should basically work everywhere cudd-2.3.0 works.
Use the same compilation setting if everything else does not work.
For further details see cudd-2.3.0.



SANITY CHECK
============

Directory exp contains sample files (in blif format) to the package and script
files to run it.
Check the README file on this directory.




DOCUMENTATION
=============

The main directory and each source directory has a doc directory that contains
html and text documentation for report and user manual.
The main doc directory contains a PostScript document describing the main
features of the pdtrav package.
In all the subdirectories the recommended starting point is
pkgIndex.html.
