This package contains the main function to exploring the state
    space of a FSM.<br>
    There are three methods for image computation:
    <ol>
    <li> <b>Monolithic:</b> This is the most naive approach possible.<br>
       This technique is based on building <em>monolithic transition 
       relation</em>. It is the conjunction of all latches transition
       relation. If we use <em>y</em> to denote the next state vector,
       <em>s</em> the present state vector, <em>x</em> the input 
       vector and <em>delta()</em> the next state function, we define the
       trasition relation of <em>i</em>-th latch to be the function 
       Ti (x,s,y) = yi <=> delta(i)(x,s).<br> Then, for a FSM of n latches,
       the monolhitic transition relation is:
       <p>
       T(x,s,y) = T1(x,s,y)*T2(x,s,y)* ... *Tn(x,s,y)
       <p>
       When the monolithic TR is built, the traversal algorithm is executed.
       This method is suitable for circuits with less than 20 latches

    <li> <b>IWLS95:</b> This technique is based on the early quantification
    heuristic.
       The initialization process consists of following steps:   
       <ul>
       <li> Create the clustered TR from transition relation by clustering 
            several function together. The size of clustering is controlled
            by a threshold value controlled by the user.
       <li> Order the clusters using the algorithm given in
            "Efficient BDD Algorithms for FSM Synthesis and
            Verification", by R. K. Ranjan et. al. in the proceedings of
            IWLS'95. 
       <li> For each cluster, quantify out the quantify variables which
            are local to that particular cluster.
       </ul>
    <li> <b>Iterative squaring:</b> This technique is based on building the
       <em>transitive closure (TC)</em> of a monolithic TR. Afterwards, TC
       replace TR in the traversal algorithm. 
    </ol>
