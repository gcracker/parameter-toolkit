The <b>DDI</b> package provides functions to manipulate the 
    following objects:
    <ul>
    <li>boolean functions (Ddi_Bdd_t)
    <li>arrays of boolean functions (Ddi_Bddarray_t)
    <li>variables (Ddi_Var_t)
    <li>arrays of variables (Ddi_Vararray_t)
    <li>sets of variables (Ddi_Varset_t).
    </ul>
    It can be viewed both as a portability interface, concentrating
    all dependancies from the BDD package, and as an upper level,
    manipulating the previously listed BDD based data types.
    A particular feature, distinguishing this interface from other ones,
    is the support for partitioned (conjunctive as well as disjunctive)
    functions.
    This implementation is written on top of the CUDD package.
